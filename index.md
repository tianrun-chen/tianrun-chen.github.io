## About Me

As a master's student of Computer Science at Zhejiang University, I am currently being advised by Professor [Xiaowei Zhou](http://xzhou.me/). Prior to this, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the same university in 2022. My research focuses on 3D/4D reconstruction and editing.
